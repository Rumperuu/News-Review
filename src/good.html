         <div class="description">This kind of breaking-down of language barriers is just another step towards a more connected world, and all those future schoolkids can thank computer scientists for not having to sit through interminable French lessons.</div>

         <div class="description">The rapid decrease in weight and other overheads on things like prostheses and exoskeletons will drive a Moores' Law-style growth in the sector, especially with up-and-coming supermeterials with strength far higher than their weight, such as carbon nanotubes. This is really cool. I want to be a cyborg.</div>

         <div class="description">This one might be a push, but I don't care. With computers enabling amazing feats in spaceflight (the Rosetta mission, SpaceX's landing of their craft), the public are finally shaking off their apathy about space exploration. An "almost three times" increase in applications is exciting, and it can only be a matter of time until we're ready to go full <i>Star Trek</i> - someone tell John Mariani.</div>

         <div class="description">Robots are another field experiencing rapid advancement. A robot that can withstand a beating had obvious uses in emergency situations, such as burning buildings where beams may drop and so forth, as well as (potentially a grayer area) areas with enemy combatants/riots, where they could pacify with a minimum of danger to human life.</div>

         <div class="description">I've been fascinated by cyborgry and protheses ever since reading Kevin Warwick's <i>I, Cyborg</i>, and it's really cool to see these projects bearing fruit. Beyond that, sense restoration holds the key to granting sufferers of these injuries a whole new lease on life.</div>

         <div class="description">We invent amazing new robots, and then put them to work delivering pizza. I can't think of anything more triumphantly human than that.</div>

         <div class="description">AI has made leaps and bounds since besting Kasparov, and beating Sedol in Go is an amazing feat that shows the potential for these new neural network and deep learning techniques. Hopefully things won't go full Skynet any time soon.</div>

         <div class="description">It's a lot easier to send out an app to an isolated third world village than it is to send a doctor. As remote medical technology advances, this could both change and save lives in developing nations, such as those hit by the Ebola epidemic last year.</div>
